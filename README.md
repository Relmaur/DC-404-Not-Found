## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
   :: Right in here! -> https://dc-404-not-found.vercel.app/
- What was your experience?
   :: Hmm... It was great, listening to Readiohead, with a good coffee, it was pure relaxation, man!
- What have you learned/improved?
   :: Perhaps not to overlook the CSS resets, they are important indeed.
- Your wisdom? :)
   :: Well, I know a thing or two about the CSS, I'm constantly trying to implement new things.
